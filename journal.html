The first three months of the bootcamp mainly focuses on Front-End Development and building skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript as the programming language. The last three months are focused on Back-End Development and Python as the programming language. If you have any questions for me or about the school that i am attending, feel free to contact me. I hope you enjoy reading my blog!

            <h4>Week One // January 8, 2017</h4>
              <p class="journalEntry"> My first week at NSS was exiting! on the first day i made sure to arrive a few minutes earlier so i could pick a seat in the front of the room where i can see and hear the instructors clearly. The rest of the day was pretty much introduction between the staff and students. We went over some basic rules, things that were expected of us, etc. 
               The following day, we watched students that finished the front-end portion of the course's projects. Each student made an application or website about something that intrests them. They used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to program thier projects. I really enjoyed viewing the students projects, it gave me a few ideas.
              When friday came along, I woke up to snow, and we were notified at 7:30am that our class will be canceled.</p>

            <h4>Week Two // January 15, 2017</h4>
              <p class="journalEntry">Week two has already passed. it feels like time is flying by! I am starting to feel how intense this bootcamp actually is. This week we jumped right into JavaScript. We were assigned a group project that we will be showing our class-mates monday. We had to include JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. We made a website about ice cream! I have nice people in my group. On friday, some of my class-mates and i went to a billards pub. It was a lot of fun! I hope that i will be about to catch up and fully understand JavaScript soon. It is still a very intimidating for me, but i know i will master it one of these days. All weekend i have been working on our group project, and i had a little time to work on personal projects too. I am exited to see what next week will bring!</p>

            <h4>Week Three and Four // January 28, 2017</h4>
              <p class="journalEntry">I have been so busy these few weeks that i didnt even have time to update my journal about my progress at NSS. The last two weeks have been intense. We have learned about so much, i dont know how to keep it all in my head. We went over SASS, Bootstrap, Modernize, Event-Handlers, IIFES, and much more. There is never a dull moment! I feel like i am always trying to catch up, but thats how its suppose to be. NSS keeps us on our toes. How else would we learn so much in such a short period of time? Some of my favorite projects i made in the last few weeks were a Temperature Converter, Language Translator, Calculator, and thats all i can think of right now. I am super exited for what next week has to bring!</p>
